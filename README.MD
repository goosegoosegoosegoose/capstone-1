I don't remember what I used.
Flask,
WTForms,
Bcrypt,
SQLAlchemy,
Jinja,
Javascript click handlers (haha),
Twitter Bootstrap,
Python requests,
I think that is it?
Could grab more quotes from api but its so slow.
Also no comments for now. Think I can do it but I am tired.

Clean up README.MD professional
Features, and why

Clean up flashes to be professional?

make it look prettier

let non users look at pages but not favorite, make button that says "log in to fav" in place of fave buttons?? that seems like a lot of "log in to favorite" buttons

put rando shit on homepage

add measurements to info 

get path as query parameter in javascript, sent to python route

make a python function that saves currpath/url to session, call it during characters-quotes api call and redirect to that? cool nice

search or browse, keep button up to get more?


add tests..

skip minor character 

pagination

random quotes on homepage? pull more initially from api to work off database?
